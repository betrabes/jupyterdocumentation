# go to this website:
https://jupyter.org/

# next go to the install page
# use one of the installation methods
# (I reccomend using pip with the command:)

pip install jupyterlab

# Once you have installed jupyter run the following command in your command line:
jupyter-lab

# Go to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T5YIE and download the data in the csv format

# create a new folder for your project

# import the csv file into the folder

# next, create a new file by clicking on the following:
file -> new -> Notebook

# Start by importing the pandas and matplotlib packages
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plot

# next create a dataframe that reads the data from the csv file using the code: 
df = pd.read_csv('T5YIE.csv')

# finally plot the data using the following for loop:
for column in df.columns:
    plot.title('T5YIE')
    plot.plot(df['T5YIE'])
    plot.show()

# Congradulations, you are done!
# see the following picture link for how it should look:
